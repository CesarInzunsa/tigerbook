# Tigerbook

Tigerbook is an Android application developed in Flutter, created to provide students with a secure environment to share their questions about subjects, lost and found items, how to complete certain procedures, or find classrooms. It is an exclusive social network for university students, where they create posts themselves. The application is simple, allowing users to create posts with text and images, and save a local copy of a post in SQFLite. This feature ensures local copies are available in case a student posts about finding a lost item but then decides to delete the post to keep the item.
